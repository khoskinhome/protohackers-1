On Ubuntu / Debian, this should install the dependencies :
    ./script/install-debian-dependencies.bash

The script is in :

    bin/protohackers-1.pl

    it has a --help describing it's CLI options.

    run it like :
        bin/protohackers-1.pl --strict-numeric --verbose

    if you want it to listen to everything coming into the host :
        bin/protohackers-1.pl --host 0.0.0.0 --strict-numeric --verbose

    ( I needed to bind to 0.0.0.0 with my main router port forwarding to 9090
      on my dev-laptop, and running the tests at the bottom of
      https://protohackers.com/problem/1 )

The main code is in :
    ./lib/perl/ProtoHacker/Main.pm
    ./lib/perl/ProtoHacker/Util.pm


There is a very small test "suite" in t/

    so , assuming you have the perl testing FW stuff installed :

    prove t/
